## About Me

Hi! I'm Akash Singhal.

Write a few sentences here about yourself, such as your background, interests, current goals, or professional experience. You can style this using Markdown—add **bold**, *italic*, lists, [links](https://example.com), or even images.

- Example: I am a passionate engineer interested in robotics and AI.
- Example: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR_LINKEDIN).
