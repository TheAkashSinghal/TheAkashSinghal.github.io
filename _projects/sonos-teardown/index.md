title: Discovery Project
description: The goal of this project was to design and produce a system that could turn the handle for the door in our dorm. The implementation plan of this project was to use a servo paired with specific hardware to provide a mechanical advantage to the system. This was necessary as the door handle needed around 5 lbs of force to initiate the rotation while the servo being used was only rated for 1.2 lb/ft of torque. 
skills: 
  - Breadboarding
  - Servo Programming
  - CAD Process
