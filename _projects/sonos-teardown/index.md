title: Discovery Project
description: The goal of this project was to design and produce a system that could turn the handle for the door in our dorm. The implementation plan of this project was to use a servo paired with specific hardware to provide a mechanical advantage to the system. <br> This was necessary as the door handle needed around 5 lbs of force to initiate the rotation, while the servo being used was only rated for 1.2 lb/ft of torque. To allow the system to provide the amount of force needed, I designed a pulley system. The pulley system utilised the measured distance the door handle needed to turn and applied that to the circumference of the pulley. Using this measurement and the length of the attached servo arm, I calculated the mechanical advantage from the system to be 5.6 lb/ft of torque. <br>
